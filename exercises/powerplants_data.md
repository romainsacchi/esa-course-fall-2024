# Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Exercise: Modeling the Life Cycle of Electricity Generation

## Objective

In this exercise, you will model the life cycle impacts of five different 
power plants to represent, in a simplified way, the supply of grid electricity.
The power plants considered are:

1. Wind Turbine Power Plant (Onshore)
2. Solar PV Power Plant
3. Coal Power Plant
4. Natural Gas Power Plant
5. Hydropower Plant

For this, you will consider the following phases:
- Manufacture of the power plant
- Operation over the lifetime of the power plant

You will be given the necessary inputs and outputs for each power plant 
based on its total capacity, annual production, and expected lifetime.
