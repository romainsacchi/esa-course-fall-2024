# Electricity Grid Development Scenarios (2020-2050)

## 1. Baseline Scenario (Business as Usual)

In the baseline scenario, the grid slowly transitions toward renewables, but fossil fuels (coal and natural gas) continue to play a major role up to 2050. There is no nuclear energy contribution.

| Year  | Coal (%) | Natural Gas (%) | Hydro (%) | Wind (%) | Solar (%) | Total Renewables (%) |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-----------|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| 2020  | 35       | 30              | 7         | 5        | 4         | 16                   |
| 2025  | 33       | 31              | 7         | 7        | 5         | 19                   |
| 2030  | 30       | 31              | 7         | 10       | 7         | 24                   |
| 2035  | 28       | 30              | 7         | 13       | 9         | 29                   |
| 2040  | 25       | 28              | 7         | 15       | 11        | 33                   |
| 2045  | 20       | 25              | 7         | 18       | 14        | 39                   |
| 2050  | 15       | 22              | 7         | 20       | 16        | 43                   |

### Key Points:
- **Coal:** Gradual decline from 35% in 2020 to 15% in 2050.
- **Natural Gas:** Declines slightly, still contributing 22% by 2050.
- **Renewables:** Reach 43% of the energy mix by 2050, with wind and solar playing a significant role.
- **Hydro:** Remains stable at around 7% throughout the timeline.

## 2. Net-Zero Scenario (Aggressive Decarbonization)

In the net-zero scenario, the country rapidly transitions to a fully decarbonized grid, with a strong emphasis on wind, solar, and hydro, and the complete elimination of fossil fuels by 2050.

| Year  | Coal (%) | Natural Gas (%) | Hydro (%) | Wind (%) | Solar (%) | Total Renewables (%) |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-----------|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| 2020  | 35       | 30              | 7         | 5        | 4         | 16                   |
| 2025  | 20       | 25              | 7         | 12       | 9         | 28                   |
| 2030  | 10       | 20              | 8         | 20       | 15        | 43                   |
| 2035  | 5        | 15              | 8         | 25       | 20        | 53                   |
| 2040  | 2        | 10              | 8         | 30       | 25        | 63                   |
| 2045  | 1        | 5               | 8         | 35       | 30        | 73                   |
| 2050  | 0        | 0               | 8         | 40       | 35        | 83                   |

### Key Points:
- **Coal:** Phased out completely by 2050.
- **Natural Gas:** Phased out by 2050, replaced by renewables and energy storage solutions.
- **Renewables:** Rapid growth, reaching 83% of the energy mix by 2050, with wind and solar as dominant sources.
- **Hydro:** Stable at around 8%, playing a crucial role in the renewable energy mix.

## Assumptions:
- **Baseline Scenario:** Slow transition to renewables, with fossil fuels still playing a major role due to economic and political factors.
- **Net-Zero Scenario:** Aggressive decarbonization effort, with significant investments in renewables and storage, leading to a fully decarbonized grid by 2050.

## Challenges for the Net-Zero Scenario:
- **Energy Storage:** Wind and solar need to be paired with large-scale energy storage solutions to manage intermittency.
- **Grid Flexibility:** As coal and natural gas are phased out, grid stability will depend on flexible and reliable storage and backup power.
- **Investment:** Substantial investment is required to build out renewable capacity and infrastructure.
