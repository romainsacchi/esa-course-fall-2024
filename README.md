## Lecture Overview

The lecture provides an introduction to life cycle assessment (LCA) and its application to energy systems. 
Students will learn the principles of LCA, how to apply it to various energy 
systems, and how to use Python for a simple LCA analysis.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/romainsacchi/esa-fall-2024.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```sh
    cd esa-lca-fall-2024
    ```
3. Open the lecture slides.

4. The exercise requires a virtual environment with Python. To install a virtual environment, run:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```
5. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
6. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python
- Familiarity with energy systems, acquired from previous lectures
- Familiarity with life-cycle assessment, acquired from previous lectures
